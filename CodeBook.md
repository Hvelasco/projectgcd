## Project Description
This is the Course Project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.
We are requested to take the wearable data from Samsung Galaxy S II and tidy it up. 

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The data was downloaded from the link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip   
Here is a full description of the data: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones  

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
The original data was divided in 6 .txt files which were separated in 3 groups:  
1: A vector of codes for each subject.  
2: A vector of codes for each action recorded.  
3: A matrix of the collected data.  

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
The data was created by downloading the raw data form the link above;  
Opening each file in R;  
Modifying the data so that they can all be merged together;  
Merging and labeling the data acordingly;  
Taking the mean of each variable by action and subject.  

###Cleaning of the data
The details of how the data was cleaned is at the following link:  
https://github.com/Hvelasco/projectgcd/blob/master/run_analysis.R  

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
The dataset has 180 observations of 69 variables.  
The data are a summary of the raw data taken the mean by subject and action.  
A general summary of the data is as follows:
